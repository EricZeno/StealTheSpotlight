Munchkin Crawler
================

An incredible computer game. More specifically, the next best 2D couch-local multiplayer, party, action-adventure, compettive, hack-and-slash RPG since you were born.

The players start together and play through a randomly generated dungeon, clearing rooms and completing objectives. Once the boss of the dungeon has been defeated, each player gets their points tallied up. After going through all floors of the dungeons, the player with the most points wins.
